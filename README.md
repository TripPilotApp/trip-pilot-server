# API Reference:

### Introduction:

Are you still using MSExcel to organize your trip information? What if there is an app feature that organizes all your travel info in one place? Then, you are all set to explore your dream destination with TripPilot. TripPilot is a cutting edge travel planning app that is designed to assist you in organizing, managing, and cooperating on tasks, and information when planning a trip.

### Errors:

TripPilot uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the range 2xx range indicate [success. Codes](http://success.Codes) in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed in the information provided(eg., a required parameter was omitted, e.t.c.). Codes in the range 5xx range indicate and error with TripPilotâ€™s servers(these are rare).

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **HTTP STATUS CODE SUMMARY**

</aside>

| 200 | OK | Everything worked as expected. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | No valid API key provided. |
| 402 | Request Failed | The parameters were valid but the request failed. |
| 403 | Forbidden | The API key doesnâ€™t have permissions to perform the request. |
| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource doesnâ€™t exist. |
| 409 | Conflict | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key). |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |
| 500, 502, 503, 504 | Server Errors | Something went wrong on TripPilotâ€™s end. (These are rare.) |
